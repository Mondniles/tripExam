                &nbsp When driving downward, I always pay attention to the place and its surroundings. Some interesting
                thought always arises when I look at how free and easy it is to be here. Of course, there is always
                congestion at the centre of the day at the point of the VEF bridge, but if I travel by public transport,
                this place is always seen as a subconscious reference point, if I look out the window and see that I
                have
                come here, then I know that it is not long to go and the other side of the road is much easier than the
                first. The place often gives me inspiration to think about whether I've really done everything, and
                nothing
                has been forgotten at home. It may indeed be some halfway between my waking existence and the
                university.
                There are rare places where a bridge, a supermarket, office spaces, residential houses, a tram and other
                sculptures are encountered, talking about the factory's VEF sculptures. As I move across the bridge of
                the
                VEF, I have already entered a fifteen-minute radius to the university.
