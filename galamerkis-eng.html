            &nbsp When you see a university, memory has been programmed that it's either fine or it's bad. It's a
            place which I still think about and despite not having been there for more than a year. I still have hope,
            that I will be able to visit some of the university's events in the same format that they had before
            and MS Teams won't play such significant role in my education. In fact, I have forgotten a little, how it
            was to “go” to
            university, so I have described the emotional journey from a memory perspective, which is probably very
            inaccurate and does not fully reflect what it feels every day, but I can say that even a few days have been
            exactly the same as they have been described. In any case, everything that has remained from the time before
            the
            pandemic is already only a memory.
