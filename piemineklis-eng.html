                    &nbsp In my vision, without regard to the real nature of it, I see it as a milestone, as “I'll be in
                    five minutes.” It's always a relief to see that I've managed and the whole trip has been successful.
                    It's not finished yet, but it'll be over now. If it is noted that the road has been long, much
                    standing,
                    it is so pleasing to be aware that it will soon be possible to get out of transport and walk. In the
                    mornings, it is still interesting to see the crowds of people running past it, each in their own
                    direction. The view alone gives an energy rush and a productivity-friendly mood. The monument itself
                    seems aesthetically appealing to me, but I always have to look at it from Brīvibas Street, even
                    though
                    the most beautiful side of it is directed at Old Riga. The memory of the Freedom Monument always
                    comes to
                    mind either the rows of flowers on November 18 or those soldiers who walk past it in deep peace. And
                    now, by thinking about those moments, it is time to step out of transport and go toward university.
