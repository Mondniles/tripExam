                &nbsp "Rigas Satiksme" is a company responsible for public transport in Riga. It took care to ensure
                that
                trams, buses, vans and trolley buses were maintained, handled specific routes, repaired infrastructure
                as
                tracks and a large list of other less important functions. But in my view, that company depends on
                creating
                adrenaline for customers, because there are usually a number of questions to step in each time, can I
                make a
                difference in how many “trips” I have when I can sit down? It certainly has some effect on the rest of
                the
                day, because by folding fifty people into one tram car, the rest of the day will be willing to spend a
                little farther away from the others.
